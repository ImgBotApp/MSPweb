<h2>Fibrations in Computer Science Workshop</h2>

<p>
  <strong>23rd &ndash; 24th June 2014</strong>.<br>
  <strong>Department of Computer and Information Sciences</strong>.<br>
</p>

<p>
  The idea of the workshop is to get people using fibrational methods
  in computer science together to catch up with what each of us is
  doing, to learn from each others techniques and to possibly chart
  ideas for future development and interaction.
</p>

<h4>Accommodation</h4>

<p>
  A convenient place to stay is
  the <a href="http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/GLACIT/glasgow-city-centre-george-square">Glasgow
  City Centre Premier Inn</a>, just across the road from Strathclyde
  University. We also have a limited number of beds which our PhD
  students have volunteered up; if you would like to keep cost down
  and take advantage of this offer, let us know.
</p>

<h4>From Glasgow Queen Street Station or Glasgow Central Station</h4>

<p>
  Livingstone Tower is a few minutes walk from Queen Street Station in
  the centre of Glasgow, and about 10 minutes walk from Central
  Station.  The map above shows the general area, as well as
  recommended walking routes.
