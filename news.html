<li> Fits - at least a little - into what we do now which is roughly category theory in CS (Neil), functional programming and type theory (Conor) and databases and coalgebra (Clemens) </li>
<li> Offers us something new and exciting that we ought to have some strength in but don't. </li>
<li> Knows how to - or has the capacity to learn how to - get grants. We have big plans for the group but can only bring them to fruition if we show we can fund fellowships and RAs. </li>

    <a name="lectureship"><strong>Lectureship in the Mathematically Structured Programming Group</strong></a>

    <p>
      Applications are invited for lectureship within the MSP group at
      the University of Strathclyde The applicant's motivation must
      centre on a desire to discover beautiful mathematics of lasting
      value.  The applicant should also have an innate sense of the
      wonder of learning allied with the capacity for self-motivation
      and a track record of academic achievement.

    <p>
      The Mathematically Structured Programming Group's vision is to
      use mathematics to understand the nature of computation, and to
      then turn that understanding into practical advances within
      programming languages research. This reflects the symbiotic
      relationship between mathematics, programming, and the design of
      programming languages --- we believe that any attempt to sever
      this connection will diminish each component. In order to
      achieve these research goals, we mainly use ideas from category
      theory, type theory, and functional programming. The group
      consists of a number of internationally leading researchers
      including Professor Neil Ghani, Dr Patricia Johann, Dr Conor
      McBride, Dr Peter Hancock, Dr Robert Atkey, and our PhD
      students.

    <p>
      While the lectureship is formally in the area of Program
      Verification, this is to be interpreted broadly. Very
      broadly. Anyone interested should in the first instance contact
      Professor Neil Ghani, whose email address is "neil.ghani at
      strath.ac.uk" to register interest.  Details of the position can
      be found
      at <a href="http://www.mis.strath.ac.uk/Personnel/open/712012.pdf">http://www.mis.strath.ac.uk/Personnel/open/712012.pdf</a>.

    <p>
      The closing date for applications is Thursday July 26.

    <p>
      Mathematically Structured Programming Group<br/>
      University of Strathclyde<br/>
      Scotland<br/>

    <p>
      We have the potential to apply for funds for a 6 month post
      doctoral position. The idea is that the successful candidate
      would spend those 6 months writing a full scale grant to fund
      themselves for the next 3 years.

    <p>
      The postdoctoral position would be within the Mathematically
      Structured Programing group at the University of Strathclyde
      whose research focusses on category theory, type theory and
      functional programming. Current staff include Neil Ghani,
      Patricia Johann, Conor McBride, Peter Hancock, Robert Atkey and
      6 PhD students.

    <p>
      The candidate we are looking for should be highly self motivated
      and appreciate that without beauty, we are lost.

    <p>
      Unfortunately, the deadline is extremely short and so any
      interested candidates should contact me immediately. I can then
      tell you more about what we would need to do.

    <p>
      For more information, please contact:

      <strong>Title:</strong> The Duality of State and Observation

    <p>
      <em>Abstract:</em> In this talk we consider the problem of
      representing and reasoning about systems, especially
      probabilistic systems, with hidden state.  We consider
      transition systems where the state is not completely visible to
      an outside observer.  Instead, there are observables that partly
      identify the state.  We show that one can interchange the
      notions of state and observation and obtain what we call a dual
      system.  The double dual gives a minimal representation of the
      behaviour of the original system.  We extend this to
      nondeterministic systems and to probabilistic transition systems
      and finally to partially observable Markov decision processes
      (POMDPs).  In the case of finite automata restricted to one
      observable, we obtain Brzozowski's algorithm for minimizing
      finite-state language acceptors.  This is joint work with
      colleagues from McGill: Doina Precup and Joelle Pineau and my
      former student Chris Hunt.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Traced categories: algebraic structure of feedback and partial feedback in networks

    <p>
      <em>Abstract:</em> In the late '80s/early '90s an algebraic
      structure dealing with cyclic operations emerged from various
      fields, including flowchart schemes, dataflow networks with
      feedback, action calculi, proof theory, as well as algebraic
      topology and knot theory. This structure is now known as a
      "traced monoidal category" , after the influential paper of
      Joyal, Street and Verity, who studied such categories in pure
      mathematics, but with an eye to applications in many fields. The
      concept also occurs as a basic structure in network
      algebra. Since then, these categories have been studied, with
      variations, in many areas of mathematics, logic and theoretical
      computer science, Recently, there has been a trend to consider
      partial traces and trace ideals; indeed it appears that such
      algebraic structures may be relevant to several areas, including
      biology and physics, or indeed to any field where cyclic
      networks are used. We give an introduction to the subject, along
      with some recent advances.

      <strong>Title:</strong> Voevodsky's Univalence Axiom

    <p>
      <em>Abstract:</em> Vladimir Voevodsky has recently introduced a
      semantics for constructive type theory in which types are
      interpreted as simplicial sets. This semantics validates not
      only the usual rules for identity types but also an additional
      rule, called the Univalence Axiom. The aim of the talk is to
      explain the statement of the Univalence Axiom and outline
      Voevodsky's proof that it implies a form of function
      extensionality.
