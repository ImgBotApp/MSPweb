<h2>MSP101</h2>

<p>MSP101 is an ongoing series of informal talks given on Wednesday
mornings by visiting academics or members of the MSP group. They are
usually announced on the
<a href="https://lists.cis.strath.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/msp-interest">
msp-interest</a> mailing-list.</p>

  <dt>2014-02-05: Operads (M. Gould)</dt>
  <dd>
    Miles Gould has kindly agreed to come through and tell us about
    Operads, thus revisiting the topic of his PhD and the city in
    which he did it.

  <dt>2013-11-20: Classical Type Theories (R. Adams)</dt>
  <dd>
    In 1987, Felleisen showed how to add control operators (for things like
    exceptions and unconditional jumps) to the untyped lambda-calculus.  In
    1990, Griffin idly wondered what would happen if one did the same in a
    typed lambda calculus.  The answer came out: the inhabited types become
    the theorems of classical logic.<br />

    I will present the lambda mu-calculus, one of the cleanest attempts to
    add control operators to a type theory.  We'll cover the good news: the
    inhabited types are the tautologies of minimal classical logic, and Godel's
    Double Negation translation from classical to intuitionistic logic turns
    into the CPS translation.<br />

    And the bad news: control operators don't play well with other types. Add
    natural numbers (or some other inductive type), and you get inconsistency.
    Add Sigma-types, and you get degeneracy (any two objects of the same type
    are definitionally equal).  It gets worse: add plus-types, and you break
    Subject Reduction.

  <dt>2013-11-13: Continuation Passing Style (G. Allais)</dt>
  <dd>
    I chose to go through (parts of) Hatcliff and Danvy's paper
    <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=178053">
    "A Generic Account of Continuation-Passing Styles"</a> (POPL 94)
    which gives a nice factorization of various CPS transforms in
    terms of:
    <ul>
      <li>embeddings from STLC to Moggi's computational meta-language
          (either call-by-value, call-by-name, or whatever you can come
          up with)</li>
      <li>followed by a generic CPS transform transporting terms from ML
          back to STLC</li>
    </ul>

   Here is <a href="http://gallais.org/code/GenericCPS/definitions.html">an Agda
   file</a> containing what we had the time to see.
